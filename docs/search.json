From the sun-baked Mediterranean to the cool Nordics, occupancy levels surge in the exact same six-week window every year: July and August. This is not a weather story—it’s the result of Europe’s synchronized school calendars, summer workplace shutdowns, airline capacity cycles, and a continent-wide cultural preference for the “big summer holiday.” In this article, we look at the factors that drive this pattern and we analyse short-term rental data to quantify shows a structural pattern: Europe travels together."
